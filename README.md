COVID vs. Healthy Classification Project

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify COVID-19 cases from healthy cases based on a dataset of medical images. The project utilizes Python 3.6, TensorFlow 2.0.0, and Jupyter Notebook for model development and visualization.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of medical images containing X-ray and CT scan images of patients. It includes two classes: "COVID-19" and "Healthy." The dataset was obtained from [source link] and is intended for research purposes.

Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6

TensorFlow 2.0.0

Jupyter Notebook

You can install TensorFlow using pip:

pip install tensorflow==2.0.0

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Avr99j/x-ray-detector-covid-19.git

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook file Final_project.ipynb.

Follow the code and instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

Usage
The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to load the dataset, preprocess the images, build a neural network model using TensorFlow, and train and evaluate the model.
You can modify hyperparameters, network architecture, or other settings in the notebook to experiment with different configurations.
The notebook also includes code to visualize training and evaluation results in graphs and plots.
